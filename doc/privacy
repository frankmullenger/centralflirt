- Almost all the text and files that users upload to this site is
  available under the site license (above). Users agree to the license when they register to use
  the site for the first time. Typically that means that public data can
  be copied far and wide, for commercial and non-commercial purposes,
  and in modified or unmodified form. If you're not OK with that,
  don't use the service.
- The following data items are considered *private data* that won't be
  shared with other users, business partners, or the public at large:
  * your private notices (notices which do not have @public explicitely set in the message)
  * your password
  * your email address
  * your IM address (AIM, Jabber, or other instant messaging address)
  * your phone number
  * your "private messages"
  * your login credentials (username and password) for other services (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
  * your dating profile
- Some private data may be published in aggregate, e.g. "30% of our
  users are registered with Hotmail addresses."
- Your @public notices (including files) can be downloaded and re-used by
  other services, either one-by-one or in bulk as
  [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) files.
- Based on your email preferences, you may receive automated email
  messages for important system events, such as when others subscribe
  to your notices.
- Based on your email preferences, you may receive an email
  newsletter. You can opt out of the newsletter if you don't want to
  receive it.
- In urgent situations, administrators may send you email directly to
  your registered email address, even if you've requested no notices
  or newsletter. *Administrators will use digitally-signed email.*
- This service will comply with court orders to turn over your private
  information.
