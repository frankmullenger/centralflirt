What is %%site.name%%?
----------------------

%%site.name%% is a dating service and a [micro-blogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging) service 
rolled into one.

You can use it to write short notices about yourself, where you are,
and what you're doing, and those notices will be sent to all your admirers.

How do I start?
---------------

Start by [registering](%%action.datingregister%%), after that post some notices about yourself or search 
for other users to follow and flirt with.

How do I follow another user?
-----------------------------

Find a %%site.name%% user you like and click on the "follow" link next to their name. You will not be able to 
follow their notices straight away, but once they permit you to be one of their followers you will start 
receiving notices from that user.

What are groups and how do I use them?
--------------------------------------

Groups are a way for you to group your followers together and message them all at once. Create a group, add 
some of your followers to that group and message the group by using "!groupname" in the notice.

All of your followers in that group will receive your notice, but they will not know which group it was sent to.

Will my followers know which groups I have put them in?
-------------------------------------------------------

No. There is no way for other users to see your groups or who you have in each group.

Will other user be able to see who I follow or who follows me?
--------------------------------------------------------------

No. Your followers and who you follow is private information for your eyes only.

How to I make a post to the public timeline on the home page?
-------------------------------------------------------------

All your notices are private by default, if you want one of your notices to be publicly available on the home page
simply include "@public" somewhere in the notice and that notice will be publicly available on the web.
