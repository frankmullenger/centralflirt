%%site.name%% is a
[micro-blogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging) service
based on the Free Software [Laconica](http://laconi.ca/) tool.

If you [register](%%action.register%%) for an account,
you can post small (140 chars or less) text notices
about yourself, where you are, what you're doing, or practically
anything you want. 

What makes central flirt different is the control you have over your 
notices - you can chose who receives your notices easily and restrict 
who can view your notices as well.
