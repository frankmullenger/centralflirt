%%site.name%% is a bit different to other dating sites, it uses micro blogging 
as the main tool to connect users on the site.

The idea behind %%site.name%% was to provide a place where you could meet new people 
and send messages to them telling them what you are thinking, doing or thinking of doing.

These messages should act as a window into your personality, as well as being open invitations
to meet in many cases. 

Our goals for the future include providing a way for our users to send notices to %%site.name%% 
via text messages - so you can notify your followers when you are on the go or on a night out.
For now we are trialing %%site.name%% and hopefully you will enjoy the site and tell your friends 
about it!
