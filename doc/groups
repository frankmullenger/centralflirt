%%site.name%% users can create private groups, groups are 
basically a great way to share messages with many other users that are 
part of the same group.

Groups are largely for users to group their followers into separate 
interests and then send a notice to those followers all at once.

For example, you might have a group for dating: !dating, and a group for 
partying: !party. You can then add your followers to either group (or both),
and send all those followers a notice at the same time simply by including 
!dating or !party in the notice.

"In the green room club tonight come party... !party"

Your followers will not see the !party part of the notice and will not know 
which groups you have sorted them into.
