%%site.name%% users can create public and private groups, groups are 
basically a great way to share messages with many other users that are 
part of the same group.

Public Groups
-------------

Public groups can be started by any user, and any other user can join 
public groups to be included in the conversation. 

But, as with public notices, notices sent to public groups must have 
@public included somewhere in the notice, as well as the groupname preceded 
by an ! (!groupname).

If either the !groupname or the @public parts of the notice are missing then
the notice will not be successfully sent to the group.

Private Groups
--------------

Private groups are largely for users to group their followers into separate 
interests and then send a notice to those followers all at once.

For example, you might have a group for dating: !dating, and a group for 
partying: !party. You can then add your followers to either group (or both),
and send all those followers a notice at the same time simply by including 
!dating or !party in the notice.

"In the green room club tonight come party... !party"

Your followers will not see the !party part of the notice and will not know 
which groups you have sorted them into.
