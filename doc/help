%%site.name%% is a *microblogging* service -- a way for you to tell
your friends and fans about what you're doing, wherever you are. You
can post small (140 characters or less) texts to the site, and all
your friends who "subscribe" to your posts will receive messages from
you.

The code is available under a Free Software/Open Source license, which
means that you can set up your /own/ microblogging service. It
supports the [OpenMicroBlogging](http://openmicroblogging.org/)
standard, so that people using different services can subscribe to
each others notices with as little work as necessary.
