%%site.name%% is a dating site with a difference. %%site.name%% provides a form of 
communication between you and your prospective dates, a way of flirting via short 
messages.

The purpose of %%site.name%% is to communicate with other singles by projecting yourself,
your thoughts, your actions, your personality via short messages - and also follow and 
flirt with other users.

You will notice a lot of similarities between this site and say Twitter, there are subtle 
differences which allow %%site.name%% to focus on dating and flirting.

Your Notices on %%site.name%% Are Private
-----------------------------------------
On %%site.name%% all your notices are private by default and can only be read by your friends
on the site - those users which you have allowed to follow you.

You can still post notices to the public stream on the %%site.name%% home page, you just need 
to include "@public" somewhere in the notice.

You Choose Who Can Follow You
-----------------------------
Unlike Twitter you need permission to follow another user on %%site.name%%, and other users 
need your permission to follow you.

Once you allow another user to follow you, then you automatically have permission to follow them.

You Choose Who Receives Your Notices
------------------------------------
Ok, we've already said that your notices are private on %%site.name%% for your followers only, 
moreover, you can send your notices to just one follower, a group of followers or all your 
followers at the same time.

<h3>Sending to a Single Follower</h3>
To send a message to a single follower simply include their nickname somewhere in the notice 
using "@nickname".

<h3>Sending to a Group of Followers</h3>
To send a message to a group of your followers simply create a group and add some of your 
followers to that group. Then include the group name using "!groupname" somewhere in your notice 
and that message will be sent to all the members of that group.

You can create as many groups as you like, and add your followers to as many of your groups as 
you want. And don't worry - your followers will not know which of your groups they are a part of 
because the name of the group is removed from the notices.

<h3>Sending to all your Followers</h3>
Notices are sent to all your followers by default, so, unless you have added @username or !groupname 
to your notice the messages will be sent to all your followers automatically.


I'd love for you to [try out %%site.name%%](%%action.datingregister%%) and let me know what you think.
