[change from using tag uris to http urls for identifiers
Evan Prodromou <evan@prodromou.name>**20080620071700
 
 Weirdly, I got in an argument with Tim Berners-Lee in #swig about the
 tag URIs I was using in FOAF documents. Eventually, I was convinced
 that it's a better thing to use HTTP URLs instead. So, now we have
 HTTP URLs.
 
 The tricky thing was for users. Since they can change their names, we
 can't use their profile URL, since it includes the name. Instead, I
 made up a new action, which simply redirects from a user ID to their
 current profile URL. This should be sufficiently long-term.
