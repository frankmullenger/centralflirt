[remove check immediate
Evan Prodromou <evan@controlezvous.ca>**20080622173341
 
 After getting a lot of problems and bugs with this, I'm removing the
 check_immediate code. Instead, I'm going to add this functionality in
 JavaScript. I think that's a preferred practice, anyways.

[implement rememberme functionality
Evan Prodromou <evan@controlezvous.ca>**20080624025234
 
 Added a checkbox on login or register to remember the current user. If
 the login is successful, this sets a cookie with a random code (saved
 in the DB). If they come back, and they aren't logged in "normally",
 we check to see if they have a rememberme cookie. If so, we log them
 in.
 
 However, they can't change settings -- cookie theft is too prevalent.
 So we mark a session as having a "real" (password or OpenID) login, or
 not. In settings pages, we check to see if the login is "real", and if
 not, we redirect to the login page.
